## Kite design software

![WingCalc Kite Software](http://www.wingworks.de/wp-content/uploads/wingcalc_kite_software-2-300x169.png)

To create the 3D Model of the kite and the dxf plans I'm using my software [WingCalc](http://www.wingworks.de/kite-design/3d-software-wingcalc/). The software is not part of the project and not (yet) OpenSource. I'm also working on an onlineversion to make it available for everyone.
